## Inspiration

All our team members are in the content creation community, but one significant problem we face is expanding our audience. Content creators of all types (animators, news stations, movies, etc.) face a problem when it comes to finding foreign fans - finding a way to dub content is complex. For a basic 30-minute video, not only will finding someone to dub your video can cost upwards of 300 dollars, but it will also end up not sounding like you AND not being synced with your mouth. Using DeepDubbed, anyone can quickly and easily dub their videos in 30 languages without paying a single cent.

## What it Does

DeepDubbed is an innovative tool synchronizes video with user-generated or translated audio content. It leverages advanced AI models to match lip movements in videos with dubbed or provided audio, ensuring a natural and coherent viewing experience.

## How We Built It

We built DeepDubbed using a combination of technologies and frameworks:

- **Advanced AI and Deep Learning Algorithms**: We used state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques, including deep learning models, to ensure accurate lip-syncing and voice cloning.

- **Wav2Lip**: For lip-syncing video with audio.

- **Machine Learning Optimization**: Our system leverages a vast machine learning model to constantly improve the synchronization between video and audio, adapting to various languages and dialects.

- **Neural Network-Based Voice Synthesis**: Utilizing Eleven Labs API, we harnessed the power of neural networks for realistic and dynamic voice cloning and synthesis.

- **Cloud-Based Computing with Google Colab**: The entire development process was facilitated by Google Colab's robust cloud-based computing environment, enabling us to utilize extensive computational resources.

- **Automated Video and Audio Processing**: Integration of FFmpeg and YouTube-dl allowed for sophisticated video and audio processing, ensuring seamless downloads and edits.

- **Data-Driven Analytics**: We tested our project extensively to ensure no bugs in our code.

## Challenges We Ran Into

The journey was filled with learning curves, especially in achieving the seamless integration of the eleven labs API with our file processors and our wav2lip model. We also had to ensure the lip-sync accuracy with different languages, but we were able to fix these eventually.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

We're particularly proud of successfully creating a user-friendly interface that can take any video and audio input to produce high-quality dubbed content. The ability of our tool to handle various languages and accents stands out as a significant achievement. We are the only one-stop-shop that lets you put in a single YouTube link and dub up to 30 languages without spending a penny.

## What We Learned

This project taught us much about video processing, AI in voice synthesis, and the importance of user experience design in software development. We also gained insights into the potential of AI in transforming media consumption, and cloud computing with Google Collab.

## What's Next for DeepDubbed

Looking ahead, we aim to enhance DeepDubbed with more language options, improve the lip-sync AI for even more accuracy, and possibly integrate real-time dubbing capabilities. We also plan to explore partnerships with content creators and streaming platforms to broaden our tool's impact.
